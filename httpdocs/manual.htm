<p><a NAME="Overview"></a><b><font color="#993366">Overview:</font></b>
<br><span class="SpellE">Shimlar</span> is a multiplayer online RPG. It is free 
to play and only requires Internet Explorer 5 or higher to play.<p>You start by creating your character. You give yourself a name, and select 
race and gender. <br>
You can log in right <span class="GramE">away,</span> email is only for password 
recovery purposes now. <br>
After login, you find yourself in the starting area of your race at the position 
of 1<span class="GramE">,1</span>. <br>
You will see your name and statistics on the upper left, movement directions on 
the upper right, <br>
a combat option just below, and the chat in the bottom part of the screen. <br>
You can start attacking monsters right away, but you can move around a bit first 
to get to know <br>
where the important stuff is. There are four &quot;special&quot; places in your area: <br>
<span style="COLOR: #006600">1. Shop (S). </span>Here you can buy weapons &amp; 
armor, as well as sell any item. <br>
<span style="COLOR: #006600">2. Magic Tower (M).</span> Here you buy new spells, 
as well as enchant items. <br>
You can also locate other players for the price of 20k gold here <br>
<span style="COLOR: #006600">3. Shrine (R).</span> Here you go if you are dead 
to resurrect. <br>
You can also teleport to other zones for 20k gold from shrines. <br>
<span style="COLOR: #006600">4. Bank (B).</span> Bank is used for storing gold 
as well as transferring it between characters. </p>
<p>You can only purchase equipment with gold not in the bank. However you can 
only transfer banked gold.<br>
Initially you will have 100 gold in the bank. This is enough to buy two pieces 
of the lowest quality equipment. </p>
<p>Once you get out of your starting area, you can duel other players at the 
same location by choosing <br>
&quot;duel&quot; instead of &quot;new fight&quot; near the monster list. Duels only work in some 
zones. </p>
<p>When you press "new fight", you do engage in a fight with a fierce and fearsome enemy. No one would like to encounter someone way stronger, but once you decide to fight... FIGHT!<br>
	If you meet an enemy and press "new fight" before even battling it, you'll loose all your gold at hand (less weight to do the chicken run!). It's better to be a poor guy then a dead guy, isn't it?<br>
	Now, if during the battle you notice this is not really in your interest... you can still press "new fight" and run. Since the enemy is injured by your strikes or casts, he can't run that fast neither and you don't loose all your gold.<br>
	You however leave some coinage to keep the monster busy collecting for a while. The formula to calculate loss is gold at hand divided by (highest health(you or monster) divided by lowest health(you or monster)).<br>
	An example to make it clear:<br>
	<li>suppose you encounter the local Superman... you have 100 health, he has 1000 and you carry 2000 gold.<br>
	You loose 2000 / (1000/100) = 200 gold. Not bad for fleeing from Superman in good health, you still have 1800 gold!<br>
	If you're superman and the monster has 100 health, you'll loose the same amount. It's a shame you flee since you can kill it anyways, but since your self-esteem will get lower by running from a weakling there's no need to have heavy financial repercussions.</li>
	<li>suppose you meet a more or less equal enemy... you have 100 health, monster has 110 health, still 2000 gold.<br>
		You hit it a few times until it's 25 health for you, 20 for the enemy (or the other way around, it does not matter).<br>
	Then you run... you loose 2000 / (110/100) = 1818 gold. WOW. That's a lot... true, but you're equal so you'll have to run like Carl Lewis and I never saw him carrying a huge wallet around.</li>
	<b>Conclusion:</b> see who you fight. If you fail to pay attention, pressing new fight will cost you money. If you think things can turn out ugly, run as fast as you can.

<p><a NAME="Races"></a><b><font color="#993366">Races:</font></b>
<br>The land of <span class="SpellE">Shimlar</span> is populated with many sorts 
of creatures. A player can chose one of the following races, <br>
each have their own distinct characteristics:<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="500" >
<tr>
<td WIDTH="100">Human</td>
<td WIDTH="400">Humans are average at everything. They start with some
very basic knowledge in all skills, and can master every skill to a high
level, however, they won't be the best in any profession</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elf</td>
<td>Elves are frailer and a bit weaker than humans. However, they are very
wise, and excel in any magic. Elves can master any type of magic to the
maximum, and prefer to fight with either swords or staves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dark Elf</td>
<td>A tribe of elves that worships the Dark Gods. They were forced to live
in the north, and that increased their strength. Being mad about power,
they lost some of the elven wisdom, however still being more intelligent
than a human. Dark elves are masters of the blades, being very quick and
intelligent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dwarf</td>
<td>Dwarves live in mountains, often underground. They are very tough,
and are hard to kill. Dwarven skill with mining and metals is well known,
and they have an advanced knowledge of axes, being capable of mastering
this weapon to the highest limit. Dwarves aren't good at magic, however
their knowledge of heat gives them some resistance to fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giant</td>
<td>Giants are huge humanoids, living in the forests or plains. Their strength
is outmatched, while their wits leave to be desired. Giants have very limited
magical talents, and they can only master mace type weapons to a high level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Troll</td>
<td>Trolls are a tribal race. They have very high regeneration rate, which
enables them to have the most vitality amongst the races of Shimlar. Trolls
have great strength, too. Trolls are afraid of fire, but can master some
air based magic. They can use all weapons efficiently, but don't like axes
much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goblin</td>
<td>Goblins are small and quick. While having low life, they can be both
good swordsmen and sorcerers. Goblins are shunned by most races, as they
are very greedy and not trustworthy. They don't have great strength, so
mace type weapons and heavy armor isn't very efficient for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Angel</td>
<td>Believed to be the messenger of the Gods, there has recently been
a sighting of Angels starting a settlement in Shimlar. While this is rumored
to be a sign of some great battle approaching, the Angels are usually peaceful.
Angels have intelligence beyond the human understanding, and their celestial
bodies can withstand some heavy damage. While angels know all the skills
by a fair amount, they won't master any weapon beyond mediocrity, as they
dislike close combat. They can master air magic to any extent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gargoyle</td>
<td>With the opening of the Demon Gate, people started gathering up there
in huge numbers trying to vanquish these creatures of evil. One of the
more intelligent demon races decided to start a permanent settlement in
the Outworld. Known as Gargoyles, these creatures are both powerful mages,
preferring the power of cold and air, and decent swordsmen.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><a NAME="Stats"></a><b><font color="#993366">Stats:</font></b>
<br>There are five basic stats: <br>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Str</span></span>: -strength, the 
measure of how much damage you can deal. <br>
<span class="SpellE">Dex</span>: - dexterity, your chance to hit enemies and to 
dodge blows <br>
<span class="SpellE">Ntl</span>: - intelligence, the amount of your magical 
power, affects the damage done with spells. <br>
<span class="SpellE">Wis</span>: - wisdom, affects your chance to cast a spell 
successfully and to disturb enemy spell casting <br>
<span class="SpellE">Vit</span>: - vitality, determines your maximum health 
points.
<p>You character also has the following: <br>
Gold - the currency used to buy items. You get gold from monsters and players.
<br>
Exp - experience, you get this for killing monsters. <br>
<span class="SpellE">Lvl</span> - level, you gain stats each <span class="GramE">
level,</span> you can see how much exp you need for next level. <br>
Level affects what equipment you can use, where you can go, and even your 
ability <br>
to chat and use some chat commands. </p>
<p>You always have &quot;free exp&quot;. That means each time you get the exp for a new 
level, the <br>
remaining exp is &quot;free&quot;. You loose 20% of the next level cost from your free exp if you die. <br>
Your free exp can't go below 0. This also means that you can't lose a level. </p>
<p><a NAME="Weapons"></a><b><font color="#993366">Weapons and Armor</font></b>:
<br>While the statistics determine the strengths and weaknesses of a character,
items are the key
<br>to success. You can't get far by using your dagger only. Armor is important
for decreasing enemy damage.
<br>There are 4 classes of items: Swords, Axes, Staves and Maces.
<br>Shields are equipped as weapons, and are used to increase armor value
as well as chance to dodge.
<br>You can have 2 weapons or even two shields equipped at once.
<br>In each zone the shops sell certain equipment. Good equipment can only
be purchased from places
<br>that need a high level to get to. <b>You cause 3 times more damage
if you use only one weapon (no shields).</b>
<p><a NAME="Spells"></a><b><font color="#993366">Spells</font></b>:
<br>While a warrior relies on his blade, a magician uses his mind.
<br>There are 4 classes of magic Spells: Fire, Cold, Air and Arcane (healing).
<br>Each race is better at some and worse at some. If you are using an
arcane spell, it is
<br>suggested you equip it in Spell One slot, so you would heal before
damage, ensuring a heal
<br>every turn. <b>You cause/heal 3 times more damage if you use only one
spell.</b>
<p><a NAME="Specials"></a><b><font color="#993366">Special Items</font></b>:
<br>Sometimes the monsters you meet carry items their leaders don't know about.  Usually their origin is rather unknown,
maybe from a previous battle, the last rampage they went on,...<br>
Nevertheless, these items are quite ok, and commonly referred to as Shadow Items.
They allow two gems to be inserted even in lowest base items and can be upgraded <br>
to Mystic Items for a price at the Temple of Shadows.<br>
When a monster carrying these is killed, it often feels guilty for what happened, and then it drops a weapon for you.
How do monsters drop these things?<br>
First, they look at what equip you have and they choose one of the five items you can wear as a base for the forging.<br>
Second,<br><ul>
<li>if they see it's a normal items (not shadow or other special stuff), 
they drop you a <b>random</b> Shadow Item.  The class of this item is a multiplier of 5, and is determined by the base item 
they choose in the previous step.<br>
So, if you get a drop, one of your items is used to determine the class of it.  The type of the item itself is chosen at random.<br>
This means your sword can drop armor, but the class of the armor will be determined by the class of your sword, if the sword is the base item.<br>
This also means your sword can drop a spell (yay!).</li>
<li>if they see it's a non-normal item, they decide to at least give you a Shadow Item of the same type.  The class of this 
item is a multiplier of 5, and is determined by the base item they choose in the previous step.  However, the class can be 
anything between I and the class as determined by your chosen base item.<br>
So, if you get a drop it'll be of the same type as one of the items you're wearing, but with a class between I and the 
class your item would drop if it were a normal item.<br>
This means your sword will <b>ALWAYS</b> drop a sword.  The class of the shadow item will be between I and the normal class.<br>
</li>
</ul>
In very short: if you wear normal items, the class is determined by one of the items you're carrying.<br>
If you wear shadow gear, the item type is determined by one of the item's you're carrying.<br>
<br>
Concerning the Shadow Class:<br>
These items are numbered by roman numerals, and their armor/weapon/spell class only <br>
comes in multipliers of 5. So a Shadow Sword I is the same as a dagger, while a 
Shadow Sword II <br>
is the same as the 6th sword, and Shadow Sword VII has the same power as the 31th sword. <br>
These items only sell for very little to the shop, but can usually be traded 
with other players for vast amounts of money. <br>
The exact class of a shadow item is calculated like this: <br>
<i>biggest number <b>divisible by 5</b> which is <b>smaller or equal</b> to <b>
(base of equipped item-1)</b></i>
<br>
Or in math: max((itemclass-1)-((itemclass-1)%5),1)<br>
An exception is made for shadow items, as they now drop their own level as well, but starting from the lowest.<br>
Or in math: random(1,max(itemclass-(itemclass%5),1))<br>
A Shadow VII sword can drop another Shadow VII sword.<br>
The present chance for getting a shadow drop is 1/9,000.<p><b>

<p><a NAME="Masteries"></a><b><font color="#993366">Masteries</font></b>:
<br>If a starting fighter gets the best weapon, he won't be very good with it. 
An apprentice magician <br>
may learn even the most complex incantation, but the odds of it being properly 
used are low. <br>
With time, you will get more skill in a chosen weapon or spell, increasing you 
mastery of it. <br>
Mastery affects chance to hit and chance to score critical damage. You mastery 
can increase <br>
after a certain number of successful hits, and each % is harder to get. Each 
race also has a certain <br>
maximum mastery in each type of item that can be achieved as well as a certain 
starting bonus. <br>
Starting bonus can be negative, as for example Giants are very bad at magic.
<p>There is a special mastery called &quot;<span class="SpellE">doublehit</span>&quot;. It 
allows you to attack or cast two times a round with <br>
each weapon or spell. Every race starts with 1% of <span class="SpellE">
doublehit</span> chance, and it increases very slowly. <br>
You can't increase it in the temple, but you don't lose it in reincarnation. 
Your chance to hit twice is <br>
exactly your % in this mastery, meaning that 50% will make you attack twice 50% 
of the battles. </p>
<p>The Royal Academy, is located at <b>14, 21</b> in <span class="SpellE">

<p><a NAME="Removing"></a><b><font color="#993366">Removing Gems:</font></b>
<br>Gems can only be removed at a temple, since the process of enchanting binds 
the gem to the item and <br>
alters the item's structure. You never know what will happen when you try to 
remove the gem from the <br>
item, but the following might happen: <br>
<i>-you get the gem out and the item remains as well (40%)</i> <br>
<i>-you get the gem, but the item is destroyed (30%)</i> <br>
<i>-the gem is destroyed, but the item remains (30%)</i> <br>
<b>Items with two gems produce both gems out if the item is destroyed.</b> <br>
It costs 100,000 gold to attempt disenchanting gemmed items. Temples are marked 
by a G on the local map. <br>
(It might take two attempts to fully disenchant an item with two gems).<p><a NAME="Zones"></a><b><font color="#993366">Zones</font></b>:

When you leave a zone, you find yourself in the <span class="SpellE">Outworld</span>. 
It is also a kind of zone, albeit without any <br>
shops, a kind of world map. In <span class="SpellE">outworld</span>, other zones 
can be found. Each requires a certain level to <br>

<span class="SpellE">pms</span>) by setting <br>
your ignore level using a <b>/<span class="SpellE">ignlvl</span> level</b> 
command. You will always get messages from <br>
moderators and higher, and you can't set this number below 1 or above your

<span class="GramE">There</span> is also a <span class="SpellE"><b>Roleplay</b></span>

will lead to mute.
<p><b><font color="#993366">Clan/Race chat:</font></b>
<br>The fourth chat channel is special, as the messages in there can only be

of either same clan or race as you. Typing a normal message here will make it be

tagged with the clan name, and will appear to all clan members. <br>
Typing <b>/r message</b> anywhere will send a message to this channel to all 
players of your race. <br>
Note: for security issues, <span class="SpellE">mods</span> can see all races, 
and <span class="SpellE">archwizards</span> can see everything, they <br>
can still only send messages as everyone else. If you are not in any clan, your 
message will <br>
not be sent to anyone. PK messages, quests and Official Announcements are sent 
here as well. <br>
Clan leaders can send a message to every clan member (even offline) by typing <b>
/mc message</b>.

Moderator, or<span class="GramE">&nbsp; MOD</span> is a person with the power to mute and curse others. <span class="SpellE">Mods</span> can be<br>found using the Mod link at the bottom of the screen.
Mute syntax is <b>/mute player: hours</b><br><span class="GramE">You</span> don't have to CAP the 
first letter. 48 hours is the maximum mute,<br>
except for a perma mute. The syntax for a perma mute is <b>/perma <span class="SpellE">playername</span></b>.<br>
If a player is not spamming but still annoying there is a curse command.<br>
The syntax is <b>/curse player</b> and it lasts for an hour. It makes
them write backwards.<br>For players that use excessive CAPS there is a capscurse.<br>
The syntax is <b>/caps player</b> and it also lasts an hour. All text they type will be in lowercase.<br>
<span class="SpellE">Mods</span> can send the link to the

<b>/new player</b> command. <br>
Mods also have RP only commands. They are <b>/d</b> for bold white text (descriptions),<br> there is <b>/dp</b> for dark priest/demon priest, and 
<b>/p</b> for The Priest.<br>
All moderators and above can use the <b>/w</b> command to make the text appear

<p><a NAME="Quests"></a><b><font color="#993366">Quests:</font></b>
<br>The <b>QuestMaster Hut</b>, found in the outworld, offers quests every hour. 
The point of the quest is to kill <br>
a certain &quot;special&quot; monster in some zone, then return to get the reward. You can 
only sign up for one <br>
quest at a time, and you can only get reward for a quest you have signed up to. 
Many players can sign up <br>
for the same quest, and only the first one to complete it gets the reward. 
Quests have level limits, so that <br>
newbies get a chance, and the high level players don't take up quests that are 
only chum change for them. <br>
The quest board does not show which exact monster you have to defeat, so that 
player have to fight <br>
through a load of opponents to get the quest done, increasing the chance 
and making it possible for<br>
players with dialup connection to complete quests.
<p><i>You can only complete one quest every 8 hours. This is made to prevent 
players with high speed</i> <br>
<i>connections or those that are online for long times to gain all the rewards.</i>

<p><a NAME="Creature"></a><b><font color="#993366">Creature Hunts:</font></b>
<br><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">
Occasionally, a legendary creature will attack some zone. Players in that zone 
can all fight the creature, <br>
which has usually millions of HP, but low stats so can be hit by almost anyone. 
Damage done to the <br>
creature is divided by your level, and you deal at least 5000 damage to it if 
you hit. The one to kill <br>
this beast will receive some rare equipment, and everyone who was attacking it 
(and no other monsters) <br>
and is in the zone at the moment of the kill will receive a set amount of gold.

Chaos is found in Demon <br>
Gate. Search near shrines to find the entrances. Most of DoL is non pk, and the

250 to enter and has a <br>

base cost to buy an estate is <b>20 million</b>. <br>
You get a <i>10 items</i> stash and can heal at your estate. You can upgrade the 
estate for a price, to <br>
get more items slots in stash (upto 50), and also a custom description line and 
even a flag. <br>
You can even share a house with another player if you buy that upgrade. The

a <b>mine</b> which sometimes makes you get specific extra gems, and a <b>

<br>&nbsp;<p>Alignment represents your faction, neutral, evil or good. It mainly 
affects the cost of sacrifice at different temples. <br>
Temple of Order sacrifices cost less for those on the positive side, while 
Temple of Chaos is for the evil players. <br>
Temple of Shadows costs are same for everyone, and slightly more than others.
<br>
Sacrificing gold at a temple can change your alignment to the one of the temple 
a bit. <br>
However, the real way to change it is to kill another player. If you kill a 
player with positive alignment, you will<br> lose 1 alignment. If you kill a player
with a negative alignment, you gain 1 alignment, unless the player is at least<br>
a certain level. You also can get a (<b>+/-1</b>) alignment change from fighting monsters in some zones.<br>
Ta'lorn and Demon Gate are known for increasing alignment, while Gem Pond 
and Essence of Malice lower it. </p>
<p><b><span style="COLOR: #006600">Alignment over 99 is good and shows in chat

	</table>
<a name="what">&nbsp;</a><h4>What is turn based playing in Shimlar?</h4>
<p>Apart from the normal way of playing, where you can click an unlimited amount of time, the turn based way is limited in some aspects and extended in others.<br>
	First of all, to <b>create a turn based char</b>, you simply go to the login page and create a char. On the bottom of the page is now a drop down box. If you select "turn based", you create a turn based char.<br>
	So, you validated your char and you're ready to log in... just do it. It'll all be the same.<br>
	Chat is shared, so that the entire player base can talk to each other. This also means you can't have the same char name turn based and normal. You can just start clicking away...<br>
	Perhaps you'll notice a number decreasing below your name. It's the number of free turns you have. Every time you click "new fight", it goes down with one. When it's at 0, you can't fight anymore against monsters.<br>
	Fighting against players is always possible!! You can even see the normal players.<br>
	Now, as turns get depleted, they're refilled as well. Every hour, you get 45 turns with a max of 5400 turns (that's 5 days).<br>
	As time and resources are limited, it'll force you to define a better strategy for your char's development, while still maintaining a decent level of luck.
</p>
<a name="what">&nbsp;</a><h4>Some concepts of turn based playing.</h4>
<p>
	<b>Fame</b> is a calculation based upon your level, your gold, the number of pk's (and also the level of your opponent), the quests you do and clanpower.<br>
	It's a very powerful calculated value that'll get the top list moving faster then ever (if you buy stuff, you'll drop!!).<br>
	Fame is how turn based players are ranked.<br>
	<b>No trade</b> is implemented to weed out twinks, item sharing and loans. It's less problems for me, and will force you to focus on your own character.<br>
	You won't get pk'ed by twinked chars neither. Your friend won't get banned with your stuff on him/her. If you want something, you'll have to obtain it yourself.<br>
	For that purpose, smash prices in the shops are higher.<br>
	<b>No gold exchange</b>, apart from clan vaults. This is done to avoid people running 154865 chars for gold.<br>
	<b>Clans</b> will be either for turn based, or not for turn based players. This is to avoid the awarding of additional gold to turn based chars.
</p>
<a name="aim">&nbsp;</a><h4>What's the use?</h4>
<p>
	Don't ask for use in an online game :-). What I try to obtain is that people depend less on <b>who they know</b> or how <b>much time</b> they have.<br>
	While community counts in your fame through clanpower, you're basically on your own for the way to the top. So plan carefully, don't buy the first item you think of.<br>
	The main purpose is however to stop nagging the players in the normal version with anti-macro measures. The turn based version is a fun and different style of playing, which makes it less interesting to run macro's.<br>
</p>
<a name="differences">&nbsp;</a><h4>What are the differences?</h4>
<p>
	<b>The limit on the fights</b> you can do every day. PK'ing does not count!!<br>
	<b>The pk system</b> is different as a whole. If you pk a player lower then your level, you will loose the difference in lvl * 100 fame. If your target is higher, you'll win the difference in level * 1000 fame.<br>
	Apart from that, every pk is worth 1000 fame points. Which means that if you pk someone 10 levels lower, you'll get 0 points. If you pk someone 10 levels higher, you'll get 11000 points.<br>
	When killing another player, be it a normal or a turnbased one, the turnbased player receives:<br>
	- between 1 and 10% of the targetted player's gold<br>
	- fame, according to the other player's level<br>
	The targetted player looses, like before, his gold and free experience.<br>
	The gold loss is to cover the costs the Shimlar Governement makes to clean up the mess after the kill :)<br>
	<b>Smash prices</b> are three times higher for gems and accessories.<br>
	<b>Drop chances</b> are overall way higher (up to 3 times!) in TB.<br>
	<b>The drop system</b> itself is different as well.<br>
	- if you get a gem, you have two chances to get the higher grade (+1*) of a gem plugged in an equipped item<br>
	- if two chances aren't enough to find a gem, a random * gem is generated<br>
	- if there is a gem found and it's already ****, then it's duplicated<br>
	This means that the more gems you have equipped, and the better they are, the better your gems will be.<br>
	<b>Concerning items</b>, if an item drops, it'll be a DUPLICATE of ONE item you have equipped, INCLUDING the gems.<br>
	As you're so eager to get it, it's equipped straight away while your previous item is "dropped" and placed elsewhere in your inventory.<br>
	If the chosen item however is a shadow or higher, it's DUPLICATED.<br>
	<b>Turns can drop</b> too, in fact, if nothing else drops, you have a 1/500 chance to receive between 1 and 540 turns.

<b>Drops:</b><br>
<li>You will never find a good gem/shadow drop except when you don't need it.</li>
<li>Shortly after buying a gem you will find an exact duplicate from a gem drop.</li>
<li>Kings will never give you a gem drop. If they do, it will be a malachite*/**.</li>
<br>
<b>Quests:</b><br>
<li>If you really need to do a quest, someone else will complete it within 3 seconds of them appearing.</li>
<li>Shortly after going to the Questmaster's Hut and the quests appearing you will find out that you can't do quests again yet.</li>
<li>Finding a special is a sure sign that someone else found it a split second before you.</li>
<li>If you find the winning special then someone will PK you.</li>
<li>When logging onto shim you will find out that you logged on a few minutes too late for quests.</li>
<br>
<b>Fanatics:</b><br>
<li>If you become tired, the next monster will be a fanatic.</li>
<li>If you stop concentrating at the upper half of the screen, the next monster will be a fanatic.</li>
<li>If you are in a zone with a purple background, you will somehow mistake the word fanatic for the background.</li>
<li>If you encounter a fanatic right before leveling and attack it, it will double-critical and kill you.</li>
<br>
<b>PKing:</b><br>
<li>You ARE about to attack a twink and die. Give up.</li>
<li>If the target is somehow not a twink, you will get double/triple/quadruple-criticalled and killed.</li>
<br>
<b>Fancy Confirmation "Are You Sure?" Popups</b><br>
<li>Despite the warning, you will buy the wrong item.</li>
<li>Despite the warning, you will sell the wrong item.</li>
<li>Despite the warning, you will trade the wrong item.</li>
<li>Despite the warning, you will enchant the wrong item.</li>
<li>Despite the warning, you will disenchant the wrong item.</li>
<li>If you do buy/sell/trade/enchant/disenchant the right item, you will shortly find out that it was a bad idea anyway.</li>
