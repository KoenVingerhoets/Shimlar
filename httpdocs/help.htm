  	Thanks to Gobby, we found Lady Eleannah on RuneScape. She updated the shimlar.com url, so it all points to the new server now.<br>
  	Alas, we overlooked a small configuration issue on the new server, and it doesn't support MySQL yet. Once that's fixed all will work. But it's the reason it doesn't work now.

    <br><b><i>Below the history behind our downtime.</i></b><br>
    <li>2006-09-18: Lady Eleannah sent me confirmation that she changed the DNS data. So, pretty soon, you'll see the game again when you type www.shimlar.com. It can take up to 3 days nevertheless, depending on how fast your ISP updates the DNS database.<br>
			Meanwhile, Morpheus and I are fighting a bit with the latest versions of about everything we use, as it has by default a far higher security, which causes some files to be unreachable. </li>
  	<li>2006-09-17: Morpheus did a great job on the server already... I took a small preview through the admininstration panel already :=)<br>
			Furthermore, Lady Eleannah responded to my messages, and I passed her the data to change the IP where the URL points to. Now only time is against us, as DNS propagation doesn't work immediately.</li>
		<li>2006-09-15: We have a new server up and running!! Morpheus will try to get the setup work done by the end of the weekend.<br>
			As the URL is still owned by <b>Lady Eleannah</b>, we're trying to find a way to get in touch with her.<br>
			If you play RUNESCAPE, she plays it as "Eleannah", ranked 462. If you see her, please let her now I'm looking for her!</li>
		<li>2006-09-13: Morpheus ordered a virtual dedicated server solution. He made an arrangement with the new host that we're able to test this before going dedicated if needed.<br>
			What's all the geek-talk? Well... Shimlar will now run on a VERY powerfull server that is shared with other people. They all have their own virtual server on the server.<br>
			While each has a dedicated amount of resources, the remainder is used where needed. And that will be Shimlar :)<br>
			I'll keep you posted on the status, but Morpheus first has to install and configure it again.</li>
		<li>2006-09-10: Morpheus has connected some other providers. We will most likely obtain a better server for less money.</li>
		<li>2006-09-08: I found the page from <a href="update.htm" target="_blank">Google blacklistings</a> on which our server (IP: 216.180.251.229) is shown.</li>
		<li>2006-09-08: on mIRC - <i> <nysupport> Your original box is a "post-toastie" according to Gary.  He's suggesting you can either get a newer server with us (slightly higher cost) or get a "cheapy" from ev1servers.  We just dont have anything of that class available right now.</i><br>
			Slightly higher would be 149$/month. I cancelled the payment for the current server (due 10 sept.) because it's obviously not coming back.</li>
		<li>2006-09-05: We re-opened a ticket with ID FB4CEC at the DixieSys helpdesk, it was closed without resolution stating that Gary was needed. As we know he is in another datacenter, we can only guess when our server will be back.</li>
		<li>2006-09-04: The ticket is closed, looks like they have several servers offline and Gary will need to help getting more servers in the air.</li>
		<li>2006-09-02: The server goes offline, DixieSys powered it down. Morpheus contacted them on IRC and created a support ticket with ID F1A34B. We are informed that two phishing scams ran on it.</li> 
		<li>2006-08-29: The IP's involved in the hack do not appear in the players database.</li>
		<li>2006-08-28: Morpheus checks the logs and notices an endless list of thousands of login attempts on SSH. He changes the password and blocks all the IP's.</li>
		<li>2006-08-28: I contact Gary on mIRC, he notices that the SSH module has a different timestamp. He guesses Morpheus updated something.</li>
		<li>2006-08-28: Morpheus notices the problem too and tries to contact DixieSys, not an easy job as he's travelling. We have at that point no idea what happened.</li>
		<li>2006-08-27: When logging in to the server on SSH to update the code, I notice that the key is changed. I contact Morpheus.</li>

  	Please scroll DOWN to read all the ideas and stuff that's done already.<br>
  	<font color="red">PLEASE realise this is a status update, not the current status of the game.<br>
  	I will have to reset the game to implement this. If you have ideas, or see flaws, or think I overlooked something, please use the CONTACT page (link above).
  	Select the BLUE topic and fill out the rest of the page. I will limit myself to read ONLY those emails. Sorry.</font>

  	<i>update</i><br>
  	Due to some complaints (quite early I must admit), I decided to make it so that you can play either turns based, or not.<br>
  	I will <b>ONLY</b> support the turnbased version for problems in game. Stat ban will be removed.<br>
  	In this setup, I most likely won't reset.<br>
  	<i>end update</i>
  	<br>
  	<br>
  	Started recoding Shimlar. This will be like when it just started... you could really consider this round a beta test round.<br>
  	You can launch a new fight 720 times a day (24 hours * 30 turns an hour). This can be changed if needed, I'm also new to this :)<br>
  	You can save up to 5 days of fights (3600 fights).<br>
  	Duels are ALWAYS possible.<br>
  	If I put the code online, it's only a test. I still have the old working code as well, and a list of files I need to change. It can be undone quickly.
